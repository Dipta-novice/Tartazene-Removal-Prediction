## üìå Highlights of the Study
- Removal of **tartrazine dye** from polluted water using **Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs)** synthesized via **Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)**.
- **98.39% removal efficiency** achieved within 60 minutes at pH 6 and room temperature.
- **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** used to study adsorption interactions.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** (ANN) models developed for predictive analysis of dye removal efficiency.
